How to swim in the deep water - A lone writer’s guide to survival
=================================================================

Before you start:
---------------

* You might not need to create your own style guide: 
     * Talk to other writers at your company (marketing writers, bloggers, etc.). If they have a style guide, why not use it?
     * Use an external style guide, adding company-specific terms and usage.
     

* Create a bare bones Style Guide
* Keep in mind that some "writers" are in fact some person who got stuck writing the docs but are really in Support, Product Engineering, or even Marketing.
* Try to provide real examples of what not to do. For example in a section on Writing for International Audiences, you might say - Don’t use words like “may”, use “might” or “can”. You might say - Avoid contractions - especially contractions that are in future or past tense or are passive, such as “wouldn’t”, “couldn’t”, “didn’t”.  Depending on the “tone” you want to set for your docs, you might decide to use present tense contractions such as “don’t” or “can’t”.
* Here is a link to a resource with some ideas (it is too in-depth for a bare bones guide, but might trigger some thoughts: `Style Guide Guide, a boilerplate for style guides) <http://bradfrost.github.io/style-guide-guide/>`_
