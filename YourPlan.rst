You need a Plan
****************
You need a plan to get you from point A to point B, but also for the following purposes:

* To show your boss the path ahead
* To prioritize the numerous tasks ahead of you
* To communicate with Key Stakeholders to ensure that your tasks aligned with the Company's needs and that you have enough context to get started.
