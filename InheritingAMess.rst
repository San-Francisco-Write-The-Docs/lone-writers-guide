Suppose you inherited a mess like this:

* flat, unrefined knowledge base

* Overlapping content

* Redundant knowledge

* 1 person team

Think about these:

* Try to understand what the goals/priorities were of previous solutions, versus what goals you’re trying to accomplish now.

* Keep your priorities in mind when determining next steps.

* Make sure the solution is scalable; once you have a better solution, other teams will want in.

* If your audience is internal and cross-department, consider whether gating content with permissions will solve existing problems.

* How much content will change?

* Define your hierarchy

* Keep the audience in mind

* Organize docs by function/purpose/types

* Depending on whether you’re inheriting internal or external-facing content, consider breaking down content by either product/category or per-department. Using both will get messy.
