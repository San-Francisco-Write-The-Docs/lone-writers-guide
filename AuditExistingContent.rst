How to swim in the deep water - A lone writer’s guide to survival
=================================================================

When you have inherited docs from a previous writer who has left the company, it is important to know what you have inherited. Consider:

* How are the docs organized?
* Are there gaps in the content?
* Have customers complained about missing information?

Conducting a high-level audit will give you the answers to these questions.

Start by looking at the documentation yourself.  Don’t get wrapped up in the details. Look at the docs from an organizational perspective.  Is the content organized in a logical order? Can you identify any gaps in the content?

Next go to your manager and the Key Stakeholders.  Interview them and ask them about the documentation.  Show them the organization online. Ask if the organization seems logical to them.  Ask them if they see any gaps or missing information.  As them if anyone has complained that there is missing or confusing information.

If you can interview 1-2 key customers, ask them the same questions.

All of these interviews will give you a better picture of the documentation, and metrics to explain the status of the documentation to your manager.

Summarize the information that you have gathered and try to prioritize the list of things to improve.  If you can, try to estimate how long you think it will take to make the improvements.  Then multiply that estimate by 3.  Yes, 3.  It always, always takes longer than you think it will.  If it is a real mess, multiply by 4.
