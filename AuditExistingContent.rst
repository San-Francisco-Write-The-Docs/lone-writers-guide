How to swim in the deep water - A lone writer’s guide to survival
=================================================================

When you inherit docs from a writer who has left the company, it's important to know what you have to work with.  Consider:

* How are the docs organized?
* Are there gaps in the content?
* Have customers complained about missing information?

Conducting a high-level audit will give you the answers to these questions.

Start by looking at the docs from an organizational perspective.  Is the content organized in a logical order?  Can you identify any gaps in the content?  Don’t get wrapped up in the details.


Next, go to your manager and the Key Stakeholders.  Interview them and ask them about the documentation.  Show them the content online and ask them:

* Does the organization seem logical?
* Do they see any gaps or missing information?
* Has anyone has complained that there is missing or confusing information?

If you can interview 1-2 key customers, ask them the same questions.

All of these interviews will give you a better picture of the state of the docs, and metrics to explain the status of the docs to your manager.

Summarize the information that you gather and try to prioritize the list of things to improve.  If you can, try to estimate how long you think it will take to make the improvements.  Then, multiply that estimate by 3.  Yes, 3.  It always, always takes longer than you think it will.  If it is a real mess, multiply by 4.
