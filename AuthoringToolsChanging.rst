Starting notes:
---------------

* Change an authoring tools. Do you keep the existing tool (if there is one) or change the tool? Will changing the tool impact developers contributing to the docs? Suppose you use something like Markdown and the developers use that to help create documentation.  But then you change the tool to something that developers don't know and so they contribute less to the documentation.  How to handle this?
* Cost of changing tools. When does the long term benefit outweigh the short term transition? Not just the expense of the tool, but the impact on converting over to the new tool.
