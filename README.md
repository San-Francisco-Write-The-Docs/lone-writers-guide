## Introduction

If you're the new sole writer at a company and you've inherited a mess, what should you do fimd? What decisions (and trade-offs) must you address right away? What milestones should you hit in the fimd 30, 60, and 90 days?

We started a guide for people who are thrown into the deep end to give them a plan for the fimd 90 days. This hackathon continues that work.

Everyone has something to share, so join us for this project if you are (or have been) the sole writer at a company or a writer with lots of experience.

## Current Status

This guide is in active development and has not yet been published.

## Contributing

You can contribute in several ways:

* You can [edit these pages in your browser](#edit-in-your-browser-the-easy-way)
* If you feel like a challenge, you can also Fork or clone the repo and work offline, but it's not necessary. There are some helpful instructions below, if you want to try that.
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/San-Francisco-Write-The-Docs/lone-writers-guide/issues/new) here in GitHub. This allows you to report a bug or make a suggestion without having to make the changes yourself. See the GitHub docs: [Creating an Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

## Before Contributing

Before you contribute, please:

* Review the docs to get an idea of what has been done so far.
* If you already have a GitHub account, log in. Otherwise, [sign up](https://github.com/join).

## Edit in Your Browser the Easy Way

1. Use the edit button to start.
   1. It's the one at the upper right with a symbol that looks like a pencil.
1. When finished, scroll down to click **Commit Changes**.
1. Click **Create Pull Request**.

## Edit in Your Favorite Text Editor

If you want to do things the hard way, you can use the green button to clone the repo. That would allow you to work offline and in your favorite text editor. For help with Git, refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc). 
You can also download a GUI interface, if you'd prefer to work in a windowized environment, rather than the command line. If you prefer that, take a look at [Git's guide to GUI apps](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
