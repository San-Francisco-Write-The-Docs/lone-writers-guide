Here are some more suggestions for topics that could be added to this book: 

* Taking part in the Agile process
* Should you start by fixing old copy or writing new? How to decide?
* Take some points from Neal Kaplan's "Triage" presentation at WTD Portland '18.
* Gather whatever there is of existing content (internal/external, Wiki entries, scribbles on napkins...)
  * Vet that content for its quality and usableness. Do this very fast.
  * Evaluate what kinds of documentation you can deliver, weighing business value and level of effort.
  * Make a rough plan. A rough plan now is better than a perfect plan later
  * etc.
